<h1>Work and studying is tough but not as tough as you think</h1>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are  studying math or physics or chemistry , make it as a game , challenge you self to solve the problem . as well as studying history ,make it as a story . so you are studying but not actually studying</li>
<li>if you have a project or a task at your job or school , do it like a challenge to yourself that you are going to make it the best and the most perfect , make it as a competition</li>
<li>if you have a dream that you really love , like being a programmer , work on it and be happy with the pain you feel while you are doing<br> your best to achieve your goal and make your dream come true</li>

<li>if you are just working because you need money , try to forget about this and try to convince yourself that you are working <br>to have friends and have responsibility and have done something healthy in your free time</li>
<li>if you are working to win a competition , work as hard as you can , just imagine that you are the winner , believe <br> that you are the winner, imagine that how everyone would talk about how hard you worked and how great you achived</li>
<p>change the world, be creative, let them see who you really are and what you can do</p>
